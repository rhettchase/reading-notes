### To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

In consulting I would be on a different team for every project, so would need to learn different work styles, develop new set of team norms and try to foster psychological safety with different sets of people. In one instance, we had a manager who would talk down to the junior team members, using a negative tone that made them feel stupid and dismissing others’ ideas. This made working on the team incredibly difficult and it felt like we were all walking on eggshells. It degraded the effectiveness of the team, and I found myself putting in less effort since I knew it would not be good enough anyways. It was a great lesson in how NOT to establish psychological safety.

### How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

Psychology safety has positive impacts on teams

- effective group norms that are agreed upon
- sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions - intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues
- conversational turn-taking (equal proportion of speaking)
  - All team members feel that they can speak up and make contributions (value different opinions)
- Fosters an environment of trust

#### Who is Roy Fielding?

-  Roy Fielding is an individual who helped write the first web servers and conducted extensive research explaining the principles behind how the web works. He is known for his contributions to the specification of the HTTP protocol used to transfer documents across the internet.

#### Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- The techniques used in the class do not work well for talking to all machines worldwide because they were not initially designed with the requirement of global communication in mind. When Fielding and his colleagues created the web, the ability to communicate with any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern, but most later-developed techniques were designed for communication within smaller, specific groups of machines.

#### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

- The HTTP protocol, created by Roy Fielding and his friends, is a foundational protocol used for transferring documents (resources) across the internet. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

#### What does a `GET` do?

- A `GET` request is an HTTP method used to retrieve information or resources from a specified URL. When you enter a URL in your browser, it typically sends a `GET` request to the server to retrieve and display the requested web page.

#### What does a `POST` do?

- A `POST` request is an HTTP method used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is commonly used for submitting form data or uploading a file to a server.

#### What does `PUT` do?

- A `PUT` request is an HTTP method used to update or create a resource at a specified URL. It replaces the current representation of the target resource with the data sent in the request.

#### What does `PATCH` do?**

- A `PATCH` request is an HTTP method used to apply partial modifications to a resource. It is used when you want to apply changes to a resource without replacing the entire resource. `PATCH` is often used for updating specific fields in a resource.
