- **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**
  During the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science, personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. The article suggests that the percentage of women in computer science started falling around the time when personal computers became more common.
- **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

  It matters that males had been playing on computers growing up because the early personal computers were marketed almost entirely to men and boys. The idea that "computers are for boys" became a narrative that defined the computing revolution and contributed to the creation of techie culture. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home. This assumption created a gap, where male students were often assumed to have more experience and proficiency with computers than their female counterparts. This bias influenced the expectations and experiences of women studying computer science, contributing to the decline of women in the field during that period.

- **When are diversity efforts most successful?**

  Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by a commitment from company leaders. The commitment from leaders is crucial for the success of diversity and inclusion initiatives. Understanding why diversity matters is key, and this commitment should be meaningful and go beyond just meeting quotas or compliance requirements.

- **Why do diverse companies perform better?**

  Diverse companies perform better because diverse teams are smarter and more creative. Research from fields like organizational science, psychology, and education indicates that diversity brings significant benefits to teams focused on creativity and innovation. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. Studies have shown that diversity at the top management level is linked to increased firm value and better financial performance.

- **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vice versa.**

  When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they can build more effectively for those groups. For example, when YouTube's developer team was almost entirely right-handed and built the iOS app without considering left-handed users, a significant number of videos were uploaded upside down. Another example is when Pinterest shared its demographic information, emphasizing that building a team representative of the user base leads to improved product quality and impact. Walker & Company CEO Tristan Walker highlighted that a more diverse team at Twitter could generate great ideas for engaging a more diverse user base. In essence, a diverse company is better equipped to understand and address the diverse needs of its users.
