# Class-01 Reading Notes: Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown

- Markup language used to add formatting elements to plaintext documents and is one of the world's most popular markup language
- For example, to make phrase bold, add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**)

## Why do we use Markdown?

- It can be used for everything and it's everywhere! (e.g., creation of websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, etc.) and many desktop and web-based applications support it
- It's portable, which means it can be opened using most applications
- It's platform independent, which means you can create Markdown-formatted text on any devise running any OS
- It's **future proof** which means it can be read using a text editing application in the future

## Markdown how-to's & best practice

### Heading levels

- The `#` symbol will create a heading, with the number of `#` s corresponding to the heading level, (largest as `Heading 1` to the smallest as `Heading 6`)
- `Heading 1` (the largest) heading uses 1 `#`
- `Heading 6` The smallest heading uses 6 `#`s

```text
   # Heading 1
   ## Heading 2
   ### Heading 3
   #### Heading 4
   ##### Heading 5
   ###### Heading 6
```

### Formatting text for emphasis

- When making text bold, use 2 asterisks `**` before and after a word or phrase
- When making text italicized, use 1 asterisk `*` before and after a word or phrase

### Link creation

- Enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses

```text
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
```

### Unordered list creation

- Add dashes `-` or asterisks `*` or plus signs `+` in front of line items
- Indent one or more items to create a nested list
- If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash `\` to *escape* the period
- Don't mix and match delimiters (e.g., `-`, `*`, `+`) in the same list - pick one and keep it consistent
