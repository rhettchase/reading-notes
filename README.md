# Code Fellows Reading Notes

My Code Fellows reading notes

## About me

I'm an Air Force veteran, attending the Air Force Academy and going on to serve ~7 years as a Contracting Officer. I consider myself a life-long learner and have always enjoyed learning new skills. I got my MBA and was a managagement Consultant for 5 years, focusing on strategy and operations. 

I have always loved technology and been curious about learning to code, considering it a creative way to solve problems.
