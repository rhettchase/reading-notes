# Code Fellows Reading Notes

This site serves as a respository of all of my reading notes of key learnings for Code Fellows software development courses.

## About me

Hi everyone, my name is Rhett Chase (she/her). I'm an Air Force veteran, commissioned through the Air Force Academy and going on to serve ~7 years as a Contracting Officer. I then pursued my MBA and was a managagement Consultant for 5 years, focusing on strategy and operations.

>I consider myself a life-long learner and have always enjoyed learning new skills and seeing where my curiosity takes me.

I have always loved technology and been curious about learning to code, considering it a creative way to solve problems.
