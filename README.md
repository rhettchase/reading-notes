Those with a growth mindset demonstrate a **love of learning** and believe that *abilities can be developed* through grit, persistence and effort. In contrast, a fixed mindset believes intelligence and talent are *deterministic* for success. 

#### Growth Mindset Reminders
1. Embrace challenges
2. Learn from mistakes and struggles
3. Persist when faced with obstacles
