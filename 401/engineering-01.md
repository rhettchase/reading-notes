## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- experience solving business problems with limited information:
  - as a management consultant I have picked up problems that a company has decided to hire a 3rd party for. Typically it meant dealing with ambiguity, learning on the job, framing an analysis and presenting the recommendation to a client. I see many overlaps with the problem-solving strategies in programming
- As an Air Force officer I learned how to stay calm under pressure, team building and leadership

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- make sure I understand the problem statement
- break down the problem into smaller sub problems (and inputs/outputs)
  - include pseudo code
  - “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
- Debug: go step by step through solution to try to find where I went wrong
- Take a step back and reassess
- Start fresh if needed

## Things I want to know more about

- What is the right format and better tool to smoothly do the whiteboarding? InVision is pretty clunky
- Since you start off drawing first, what are some strategies to recognize/test if the potential steps are on the right track?
