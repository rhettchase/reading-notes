## What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

1. **Communicate Effectively**: The paramount advice is to communicate throughout the interview process. This means actively engaging with the interviewer, asking clarifying questions, and discussing your thought process as you approach the problem.

2. **Restate the Question**: Before attempting to solve the problem, restate it to ensure you've understood it correctly. This demonstrates your comprehension and may also reveal any misunderstandings.

3. **Ask About Edge Cases**: After confirming your understanding, inquire about potential edge cases. This shows your analytical thinking and attention to detail, qualities that are crucial for avoiding bugs in software development.

4. **Ask About Test Cases**: Request any specific test cases the interviewer expects the solution to pass. This can guide your solution strategy and also impresses upon the interviewer your thoroughness and familiarity with testing practices.

5. **Write Pseudocode First**: Before diving into actual coding, draft your solution in pseudocode. This allows you to focus on the logic without getting bogged down by syntax or language-specific features. It also gives you an opportunity to discuss your approach with the interviewer and receive feedback.

6. **Write the Actual Code**: After finalizing your approach with pseudocode, translate it into actual code. Don’t hesitate to leave comments or ask for help if you’re unsure about syntax or language-specific methods.

7. **Ask for Help When Stuck**: If you encounter difficulties, it’s acceptable to ask for assistance. Phrase your request in a way that invites the interviewer to provide a hint or guidance without expecting them to solve the problem for you.

8. **Communicate Prior to the Interview**: Engage with your HR or interview contact before the interview to clarify expectations. Inquire about the format of the interview, the topics to be covered, and any specific preparation that might be beneficial.
    
## From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

1. **Take Time to Think Before You Speak**: One common mistake candidates make is to start talking and writing code immediately after the problem is presented, without taking sufficient time to think through the problem. The advice here is to explicitly ask the interviewer for a minute or two to think about the problem quietly before starting to articulate your approach. This deliberate pause allows you to organize your thoughts, consider different angles, and decide on a strategy without the pressure of filling the silence. It's crucial to communicate this to the interviewer to ensure they understand you're actively engaging with the problem, not just stalling.

    - **Benefit**: This strategy helps in formulating a more coherent and considered approach to the problem, potentially identifying efficient solutions or critical issues early on. It also demonstrates to the interviewer your ability to be thoughtful and deliberate in your problem-solving process, qualities highly valued in technical roles.

2. **Outline the Steps of Your Solution Before Coding**: Before diving into the actual code, writing down the steps or algorithm you intend to follow is highly recommended. This involves briefly listing the key actions or logic your code will execute, but in a high-level and language-agnostic manner. By doing this on the whiteboard, you make your thought process visible to the interviewer, allowing them to follow along and understand your approach before any code is written.

    - **Benefit**: This step ensures that you have a clear roadmap to follow when you start coding, potentially reducing the chances of getting stuck or having to backtrack significantly. It also opens up opportunities for the interviewer to provide feedback or guidance early on, before you've committed to a specific implementation. Additionally, this can highlight your ability to plan and organize your work, which is an essential skill in software development.
    
## What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

- it's not really about the answer - the point is to assess problem-solving and intelligence
- thought process - how you deconstruct the problem and communicate
- practice to build confidence with basics
- push yourself on harder problems
