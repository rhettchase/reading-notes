## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- how well an operation scales / efficiency of the operations that will be performed on the data.
	- Different data structures excel in different types of operations, and choosing the right one can significantly impact the performance of your code.
- Big O: how time scales with respect to some input variables
	- different steps get added (e.g., add up the run times for each step)
	- drop constants - looking for things scale
	- different inputs => different variables
	- drop non-dominant terms
- 5 key data structures: 1) Linked lists, 2) Arrays, 3) Hash tables, 4) Stacks and queues, 5) Graphs and trees
## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- always define a base case - condition under which the function stops calling itself
- progress towards base case - recursive call brings you closer to base case

## Things I want to know more about

- what are some examples of good base case for recursion?
